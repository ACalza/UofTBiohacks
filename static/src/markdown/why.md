BioHacks 2018 will take place at the University of Toronto St. George campus Bahen Center for Information Technology. March 17th-18th 2018, we're excited to welcome Canadian undergraduate students, professors and companies. This event will feature opening and closing keynote speeches from pioneers in Biology, Computer Science and Engineering disciplines, brainstorming sessions and workshops from the industry and academia followed by an overnight biohacking session for addressing real world problems. 

Registered teams composed of undergraduates with backgrounds in Computer Science, Life Sciences and Engineering are invited to attend and learn from leaders in the bioinformatics field. 

In this two day competition, participants will have a chance to attend lectures and workshops hosted by leaders in the field of computational biology and bioinformatics, present in front of our judges, and most importantly network with everyone participating and innovate with your new friends! We will have mentors circulating to guide our participants in project development, 
design, and implementation. 

Prizes will be awarded to top three projects as selected by our judges.
