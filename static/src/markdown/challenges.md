## 1. Rethinking Genome Annotation

Nearly 20 years since the conclusion of the [human genome
project](https://www.genome.gov/10001772/all-about-the--human-genome-project-hgp/),
we know a lot more about gene function than we once did. For tens of thousands
of genes, this amounts to a huge volume of information. How can we improve on
how we associate the existing information for a gene? Consider a gene's
sequence, function, regulation, pathways it participates in, and its associated
protein(s).

Gene annotation and prediction is a process where a gene function or family is
predicted from reading a nucleotide or amino acid sequence. This process is one
of the most important steps in studying the metabolism, phylogeny, and the
overall genomic properties of a sequenced species.

With the emergence of high throughput sequencing technologies, development of
automated gene annotation methods has exploded, creating significantly more
precise and efficient algorithms. Existing tools use a variety of approaches
such as sequence alignment, artificial neural networks and statistical modeling
to name a few. Your challenge is to develop a novel method for gene prediction,
or construct a pipeline that uses a combination of existing approaches to
improve gene annotation.
