We look at the genome as software that writes its own hardware. To bridge the
gap between computer scientists and life scientists, iGEM Toronto presents UofT
BioHacks, Torontoâ€™s annual Biohackathon. We inspire you to excel in this
interdisciplinary field and invite you to join us in pioneering the field as
well!
