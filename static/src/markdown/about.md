# Bioinformatics and Computational Biology X CSSU Presents: BCB BioHacks 2018

Returning for its 2nd year at UofT, BioHacks is a two day hackathon that will feature academic speakers, workshops, and industry guests. We can't wait to welcome a hundred undergraduate participants to learn, build, and share their solutions to current challenges in bioinformatics.

Bioinformatics is a classic interdisciplinary field. At BioHacks2018, we're looking to bring computer scicene and life science students together to problem solve and apply domain knowledge. In addition, we want to expose our students to some of the fascinating research and industry oportunities local to Toronto.

We're inspiring each other to excel in bioinformatics learning, and invite you to join us in pioneering the field!
